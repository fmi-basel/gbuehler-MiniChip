\arguments{
\item{bigwigFiles}{Character vector containing the filenames (including the full path) of read alignment files in bigwig format.}

\item{bigwigNames}{Character vector containing the names to describe the \code{bigwigFiles} you are using (for example: "H3K9me3_replicate1").}

\item{bigwigGroupNames}{Character vector containing the group names to describe the \code{bigwigFiles} you are using (for example: "H3K9me3").}

\item{ROI}{A GRanges object containing your single region of interest that should be plotted. Must include seqnames (chromosomes), start, end.}

\item{CoverageSmoothing}{Logical scalar, indicating whether the coverage tracks should be smoothed.}

\item{smoothing_window}{Numeric scalar providing the window size for smoothing.}

\item{reps}{A GRanges object containing all repeats in the genome, or at least the ones overlapping the \code{ROI}.}

\item{genes}{A GRanges object containing all genes in the genome, or at least the ones overlapping the \code{ROI}.}

\item{exons}{A GRanges object containing all exons in the genome, or at least the ones overlapping the \code{ROI}.}
